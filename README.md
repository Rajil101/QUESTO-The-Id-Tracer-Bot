**RULES/INSTRUCTION**

1.You need to open these .xaml file in ui path Studio to run and make changes in it ,few indicating screenshots were replaced with blank for privacy issue ,you need to replace it with your indicating site screenshots according to your need,still some of remained same as it was on my side for better understanding of functions in process.

2.You can search your desired profile id's on Facebook and Instagram By selecting on choose options.
For searching in Facebook you need to replace your friends name in (Name Of Friends.xlsx) file ,with dummy names pre-saved  by me in that file or you need to scrap all your friend name from friends list on facebook site or app , both ways are easy to use.

3.You need to firstly login into Instagram and facebook media handles from your specified user id you want to search (NOTE: User id used to search profiles and scraped friends list should be of same id otherwise you will not get your friends name on results)
